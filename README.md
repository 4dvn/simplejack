Install MouseJack and Jackit in one go. 

This script pulls MouseJack and Jackit repo's and bundles them together in the same MouseJack folder and assumes that you already have a flashed Logitech or CrazyRadio dongle.

This script was tested in Kali Linux, so 'sudo' might need to be added to some commands if there are errors for other distros. 

This is a really dumb script, so it works best if you are in your root directory (if you aren't, it won't properly change dirs to clone the packages).

Any contributions and improvements are welcome.
