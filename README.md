Install MouseJack and Jackit in one go. 

This script pulls MouseJack and Jackit repo's and bundles them together in the same MouseJack folder and assumes that you already have a flashed Logitech or CrazyRadio dongle.

This script was tested in Kali Linux, so 'sudo' might need to be added to some commands if there are errors for other distros. 

Any contributions and improvements are welcome.
